## Show the Local Weather Free Code Camp

*Objective*: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.

* Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

* User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.

* User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

* User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.


We recommend using the Open Weather API. This will require creating a free API key. Normally you want to avoid exposing API keys on CodePen, but we haven't been able to find a keyless API for weather.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
